          Credit limits can only be combined when an existing Apple Card
          customer requests to merge their account with another existing Apple
          Card customer. Merging existing accounts is subject to credit approval
          and general eligibility requirements. Each Co‑Owner is individually
          liable for all balances on the co-owned Apple Card including amounts
          due on your Co‑Owner’s account before the accounts are merged. Each
          Co‑Owner will be reported to credit bureaus as an Owner on the
          account. In addition, Co‑Owners will have full visibility into all
          account activity and each Co‑Owner is responsible for the other
          Co‑Owner’s instructions or requests. Co‑ownership involves risk,
          including payment history and other information about your Apple Card,
          including negative items like missed payments. Addition of new
          Co‑Owner or merging existing accounts is subject to credit approval
          and general eligibility requirements. For Apple Card eligibility

          Co‑Owner can close the account at any time which may negatively impact
          your credit and you will still be responsible for paying all balances
          on the account. For details on account sharing options including some
          of the risks and benefits, see
          https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212020. Building credit “equally”
          means that the payment history and other information about your Apple
          Card will be reported to credit bureaus for each Co‑Owner. Each
          Co‑Owner is individually liable for all balances on the co-owned Apple
          Card and each will be reported to credit bureaus as an Owner on the
          account. Credit reporting includes payment history and other
          information about your Apple Card, including negative items like
          missed payments. Card usage and payment history may impact each
          Co‑Owner’s credit score differently because each individual’s credit
          history will include information that is unique to them. Either
          Co‑Owner can close the account at any time but you will still be
          responsible for paying all balances on the account. For details on
          account sharing options including some of the risks and benefits, see
          https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212020. If you are a Participant,
          you are able to spend on the account, but are not responsible for
          payments. Being a Participant who is reported to the credit bureaus on
          an account that has a negative payment history (e.g. the account goes
          past due) or is over utilized can have negative effects on your
          credit. The account owner remains responsible for all purchases made
          by a Participant. For more details including some risks and benefits
          of being a Participant, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212271.

          some risks and benefits of being a Participant, see
          https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212271. An Apple Cash card is
          required. Participants under 18 on Apple Card Family accounts must
          have the family organizer of their Apple Cash Family set up their own
          Apple Cash card. If you do not have an Apple Cash account, Daily Cash
          can be applied as a credit on account owner’s statement balance by

          a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you select it at
          checkout in the U.S. for eligible Apple products purchased at Apple
          Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling
          1‑800‑MY‑APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit.

          2023: Variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24%
          to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of August 10, 2023.
          Existing cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates
          and fee. If you buy an ACMI eligible product by choosing to pay in
          full with Apple Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject
          to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI
          purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. You’ll need to
          select AT&T, T‑Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you check out.
          An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch
          carriers at any time. ACMI is not available for purchases made online
          at the following special stores: Apple Employee Purchase Plan;
          participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for
          small businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase
          Programs, or on refurbished devices. The last month’s payment for each
          product will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments
          at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at
          any time for any reason, including but not limited to, installment
          term lengths and eligible products. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204
          for information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See the
          Apple Card Customer Agreement for more information about ACMI
          financing. Trade-in values will vary based on the condition, year, and
          configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are
          eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be eligible
          to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade‑in value may
          be applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or added to an Apple
          Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a qualifying
          device matching the description provided when estimate was made. Sales
          tax may be assessed on full value of a new device purchase. In‑store
          trade‑in requires presentation of a valid photo ID (local law may
          require saving this information). Offer may not be available in all
          stores, and may vary between in‑store and online trade‑in. Some stores
          may have additional requirements. Apple or its trade‑in partners
          reserve the right to refuse or limit quantity of any trade‑in
          transaction for any reason. More details are available from Apple’s
          trade‑in partner for trade‑in and recycling of eligible devices.
          Restrictions and limitations may apply. Some transactions may not be
          displayed in Maps. To access and use all Apple Card features and
          products available only to Apple Card users, you must add Apple Card
          to Wallet on an iPhone or iPad that supports and has the latest
          version of iOS or iPadOS. Apple Card is subject to credit approval,

          issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch. If you reside
